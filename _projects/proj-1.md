**Project Introduction**
Predicting home prices can be challenging, especially when relying on automated valuation models (AVMs) like Zillow’s Zestimate. While these tools offer a rough estimate, they often fail to capture the specifics of neighborhoods that don’t follow typical trends. Inaccurate home price predictions can have serious impacts, affecting everything from mortgage decisions to housing policies.

Philadelphia is a city of diverse neighborhoods, each with its own culture, economy, and housing characteristics. To make accurate predictions, it’s important to capture these local factors. That’s why our team worked on building a better model for predicting home prices in the city, using data specific to Philadelphia.

We collected open data from OpenDataPhilly, focusing on key variables that would help improve our model’s accuracy. Using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, we refined the model by adjusting the variables until we found the best combination to predict prices effectively across different neighborhoods. Our goal was to not only lower the error rate but also create a model that works well in all parts of the city.

Throughout the project, we faced challenges with missing or incomplete data, particularly in some neighborhoods. Despite these issues, we identified 19 important predictors, like median household income and proximity to high-performing schools, which helped improve our model. Although it’s not perfect, our model represents a meaningful step forward in predicting housing prices in Philadelphia.

By using local data and a careful approach, we have built a model that offers more reliable price estimates, providing better insights for homeowners, buyers, and policymakers.
